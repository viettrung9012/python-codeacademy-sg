    "## Why is Python named Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum) is the creator of Python and also Python's [\"Benevolent Dictator For Life\" (BDFL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life). When he started working on Python, he was also reading the published scripts from [\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python%27s_Flying_Circus), a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python.\n",

    "They provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves.\n",
